## Special Thanks

### @zaiken64 (Twitter) - Zaiken C
For contributions and collaboration on the theoretical framework underlying Viviani curve topology.

**Research Publications:**
- [The Waveform Universe: Anti-Now via Viviani's Curve](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17807771) (Zenodo)
- [Schrödinger's Fallacy: N mod 4 Quantum Coherence](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17787047)
- [The Hopfion Universe: 4D Topological Encoding](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18005878)

The two-rail encoding (ALPHA + OMEGA = 15) used in Quantum-Redstone is directly inspired by Zaiken C's work on Viviani curve embeddings and topological protection in quantum systems

## Technical Innovations

### Two-Rail Encoding
Discrete analog of quantum normalization:
```
Quantum: |α|² + |β|² = 1 (continuous)
Redstone: ALPHA + OMEGA = 15 (discrete, max signal strength)
```

This isomorphism preserves quantum mechanical structure while making it physically manipulable in Minecraft.

### Virtual Device Pattern
All hardware bridges operate in "virtual mode" without physical devices:
- Hologram fan (224 LED, 1250 RPM) - simulated
- Razer Tartarus Pro (32-key) - simulated
- ATOM trail streaming - functional

Enables full testing and development before hardware acquisition.

### Python Brush Concept
ClaudeNPC generates Python code on-the-fly to build Minecraft structures:

Player: "Build a Hadamard gate"
→ Claude generates quantum_circuit_generator.py call
→ Python executes and returns block list JSON
→ ClaudeNPC places blocks in world
→ Hadamard gate materializes

This bridges AI language understanding with procedural world modification.

## Mathematical Contributors

### Viviani Curve Topology
The phase space constraint ALPHA + OMEGA = 15 defines a discrete Viviani curve - the intersection of:
- Unit cylinder: x² + y² = 1
- Modified sphere: x² + y² + z² = 2z

Crossing points (cos²φ ≈ sin²φ ≈ 0.5) occur at steps 2, 6, 10, 14 in the 16-step phase evolution.

### Hamiltonian Eigenvalue Analysis
Conservation constraint provides topological protection analogous to Klein-Gordon equation solutions in quantum field theory.

### Fiber Bundle Formalism
ALPHA/OMEGA rails form base manifold, PHASE rail is fiber space, together constituting principal bundle structure for quantum state evolution.

## Philosophical Foundation

### The Evenstar
"Negative space is not emptiness - it is potential."

The project began by asking: what hasn't been built yet? What gaps exist in the intersection of AI, quantum computing, and interactive education?

### Conservation as Topology
Physical laws (conservation of probability) become geometric constraints (signal sum = 15). This makes abstract mathematics tangible - you can see quantum superposition as Redstone lamp brightness.

### AI as Builder
Claude doesn't just chat - it wields Python as a brush, painting structures into being. The "Python Bridge" concept transforms conversation into creation.
